## Design Reasoning

### List Items for Nav Bar

- Semantic HTML: Lists are a fundamental part of HTML and provide semantic meaning to the content. A navigation bar is essentially a list of links, so using <ul> (unordered list) and <li> elements helps convey the intended structure and purpose of the content.
- Accessibility: Lists improve the accessibility of our website. Screen readers and assistive technologies can interpret lists properly, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate your site. Using list items with appropriate semantics helps provide a better user experience for all visitors.
